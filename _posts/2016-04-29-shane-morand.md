_Think and Grow Rich_

. It was the book that completely changed my life forever," he has said. "This book helped shape my character, actions, habits and behaviors. I am forever grateful I had the courage to read it again and again and again."

• Shane became the Vice President of Sales and Marketing for a major printing firm in Ottawa, Canada at the tender age of 25, and helped streamline the launch of the world's first North American television network dedicated to success.

• Shane has worked directly with some of the industry's most high-profile speakers and trainers --- including Anthony Robbins, Zig Ziglar, Jim Rhon, Les Brown and Dr. Mark Victor Hansen.

• One of Shane's core philosophies is to work as hard as you can, not _for _someone else, but _yourself. "I developed the skill of working harder on myself than I did on my job. A job will make you a living and we all need to live, however, working on yourself will make you a fortune. There is no greater investment anyone can make than the investment of working hard on themselves," says Shane._

• Also at the core of Shane's thinking is the notion of saying no to self-doubt. "If you want to achieve success at the highest levels there is ZERO room for negativity. Self-doubt, fear, and negative emotions are the greatness enemy of success," he says.

• Shane Morand is a man who dreams, and dreams big. "My dream is to positively impact the lives of more than 10 million families,"he has said.
